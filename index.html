        <h1><strong>WORLDS END</strong></h1>
        <p> It was June 22nd 1990, our final<br>
        day of school. There were five of<br>
        us. Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page,<br>
        Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and<br>
        me. They called me The King.<br>
        Because my name's Gary King.

        who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings."
